# google-homepage
This is the one of my first web development projects, in which I recreated a simple version of the Google homepage.
To complete this project, I used HTML and CSS.
This project is from The Odin Project's [curriculum] (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
